# Week 12 Hashing - Simple Hash Table Implementation

## Objective

The Week 12 Hashing project demonstrates the creation and use of a simple hash table in Java. The program adds multiple string keys to the hash table and prints its structure to visualize the distribution of entries.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing a basic hash table with array-based storage.
- Handling hash collisions using chaining or open addressing (depending on `hashtable` implementation).
- Adding and storing string values in a hash table.
- Understanding hashing concepts and their role in fast data retrieval.

### Tools Used

- Java programming language.
- Custom `hashtable` class for managing keys.
- Array or linked structure for storing elements in hash buckets.

## Steps

1. Create an instance of the `hashtable` class with an initial size of 10.
2. Add a list of string names:  
   `"Brennen", "Alex", "Caden", "Dave", "Eli", "Gordon", "Ivy", "Jake", "Kimmy", "Mike", "Nevin", "Owen", "Pete", "Quinn", "Reece", "Sam", "Tim", "Vrabel", "Xavior", "Yvonne"`.
3. Print the hash table to show how the keys are stored and distributed across the table.
